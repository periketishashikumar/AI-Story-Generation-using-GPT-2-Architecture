# AI-Story-Generation-using-GPT-2-Architecture
This project uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model to generate coherent text based on user prompts. It preprocesses inputs and employs advanced decoding techniques to ensure diverse and meaningful outputs. The system is ideal for storytelling, content creation, and dialogue generation applications.
# What does the project do
The project fine-tunes a GPT-2 language model to generate text based on user prompts, allowing it to create custom responses such as stories, dialogues, or any form of narrative. It processes input text, cleanses it of unwanted characters, and generates coherent and relevant output tailored to the user's needs. This functionality makes it versatile for a wide range of applications like content generation, AI chatbots, and creative writing tools.
# Why the project is useful
This project is useful as it leverages a fine-tuned GPT-2 model for generating meaningful and coherent text, making it ideal for tasks like automated content creation, storytelling, and conversational AI. Its ability to preprocess user inputs and ensure diverse, high-quality outputs simplifies creative processes and enhances productivity in generating human-like text efficiently.
# How users can start projects
To start using this project, users need to follow these steps:

1:Install Dependencies: Ensure that all required libraries, such as transformers, flask, and fastai, are installed. This can be done using pip install commands.
2:Download or Train the Model: Either download the pre-trained model or train a custom model using a dataset. The project uses a fine-tuned GPT-2 model stored locally (e.g., ./fine_tuned_large_model).
3:Run the Flask Application: Start the Flask server by running the main Python script, which will host the application on a local server.
4:Interact with the Model: Users can send a prompt via a web interface or API request, and the model will generate a response based on the input. The generated content can be further customized according to the projectâ€™s requirements.
5:This simple interface allows users to integrate the AI text generation functionality into their applications or use it for creative projects.
